# Active Directory Home Lab (Windows Server 2019)

This project documents the design, deployment, and validation of a small Active Directory environment built in a virtualized home lab. The goal of the lab was to gain hands-on experience with core Windows enterprise infrastructure components and to document the process in a clear, reproducible way.

The environment simulates a small organization with centralized identity management, automated IP address assignment, internal DNS resolution, and controlled outbound network access for client systems.

## Lab Architecture Overview

**Domain Controller (Windows Server 2019)**
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS (authoritative for the domain)
- DHCP (internal address scope)
- RRAS / Network Address Translation (NAT)

**Client System (Windows 10 Pro)**
- Joined to the Active Directory domain
- Receives IP configuration via DHCP
- Authenticates using domain user accounts

The lab was implemented using VirtualBox with separate internal and external network interfaces to simulate enterprise-style network segmentation.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Active Directory domain deployment and management
- DNS configuration and dependency management for AD
- DHCP scope creation and Active Directory authorization
- Internal-to-external routing using RRAS/NAT
- Domain join and client authentication validation
- Bulk user provisioning using PowerShell
- Technical documentation and validation of system behavior

---

## Validation and Outcomes

The environment was verified through the following checks:

- Successful installation and configuration of AD DS
- DNS resolution for internal and external domains
- DHCP lease assignment to the Windows 10 client
- Domain join and object creation in Active Directory
- Authentication using domain user credentials on the client
- Verified outbound connectivity via the Domain Controller

These validations confirm that the lab environment functions as intended and reflects a realistic small-scale Active Directory deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- Group Policy Object (GPO) configuration
- Additional Organizational Unit (OU) design
- Secondary Domain Controller for redundancy
- Security auditing and event log monitoring

This project was completed as hands-on practice with enterprise Windows infrastructure concepts.
